# Daniel Freitas da Costa - Data Analyst
## About
Hello, my name is Daniel! I'm currently a medical student with a background in Biomedicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences. I had my first contact with data analysis during my Masters, quickly noticing how much I've enjoyed it, and since have developed an interest in furthering my knowledge about Data Science in general.

Having studied the basics of **python programming and data analysis** alongside an already established analytical reasoning due to my biomedical background, I've acquired an adequate skillset for any internship or entry-level data analyst position.

I have studied popular Data analysis libraries and tools such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy and Plotly**, and intend to increase my familiarity with them and other tools significantly, in order to better develop my abilities as a Data Analyst while bringing value and important insights to any project I'm currently working on.

The objective of this repository is to showcase the technical skills I've acquired during my studies and to continuously improve my working knowledge.
